# 🛡️ LinkedIn Content Analysis – Making LinkedIn Safer for Women

This project is focused on building a real-time **content moderation and analysis system** to detect and mitigate **gender-targeted harassment, microaggressions, and inappropriate content** on LinkedIn – with a focus on improving **safety and inclusivity for women** in professional spaces.

---

## 🌐 Why This Matters

Women often face subtle and overt forms of **bias, inappropriate DMs, and unsafe interactions** on platforms like LinkedIn, where professionalism should be the standard. This tool aims to:

* Flag problematic content before it spreads.
* Empower women with reporting and redressal options.
* Help platforms and organizations **create safer digital communities**.

---

## 🧠 What the System Does

* Real-time content filtering of posts, comments, and private messages
* Detects:

  * **Toxicity & aggression**
  * **Gendered language or slurs**
  * **Harassment or suggestive remarks**
  * **Subtle bias or gaslighting patterns**
* Flags messages for moderation, alerting the user and/or platform
